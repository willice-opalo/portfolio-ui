Utility-first CSS, popularized by frameworks like Tailwind CSS, allows developers to apply styling directly in the HTML using predefined utility classes. This approach promotes rapid development, reduces the need to write custom CSS, and encourages design consistency by reusing the same utility classes across components.

The main advantage is that your styles are co-located with your markup, making it easier to see and modify the UI in one place. However, it can also lead to verbose markup and may feel unfamiliar to those used to separating concerns with traditional CSS.

## Component-Based CSS: Structure and Encapsulation

Component-based CSS, on the other hand, encapsulates styles within components using techniques like CSS Modules, Sass partials, or libraries like styled-components. This method promotes reusability and modularity by allowing styles to live alongside the logic and structure of each component.

This approach is often favored in large-scale applications where maintainability and structure are critical. While it may require more upfront setup, component-based styling provides clear separation of concerns and often scales better as projects grow in complexity.
