Deploying a full-stack application means taking both your frontend and backend and making them accessible to users over the internet. This typically involves bundling your frontend (React, Vue, etc.), setting up a backend server (Node.js, Express, etc.), and configuring a database. Services like Vercel, Netlify, and Render have made this process far easier by offering one-click deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and built-in environment variable management.

Whether you're building a monolithic app or splitting frontend and backend into separate services, it's essential to understand how your code moves from your local environment to production. This includes setting up build scripts, ensuring your API routes are reachable, and handling errors gracefully.

## Managing Environment and Infrastructure

Environment variables play a crucial role in deployment. They help you separate dev, staging, and production configurations—such as database URLs, API keys, and secret tokens. Platforms like Vercel and Render offer secure dashboards for managing these variables, while Docker is often used to standardize the deployment environment across teams.

Monitoring and logging are also critical in production. You’ll want to track errors, performance, and usage patterns. Tools like Sentry, LogRocket, and Datadog can help you stay on top of potential issues post-deployment. Once everything is live, automating your deployments using Git-based workflows can help you move fast and reduce human error.
